## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Non-blocking)

### 1. Endpoint Naming
- Minor semantic variation (pending-invitations vs pending-requests)
- **Impact:** None - both work correctly
- **Status:** ✅ Documented

### 2. Pagination
- Not explicitly documented in all endpoints
- **Impact:** Low - Laravel defaults work
- **Status:** ✅ Recommended enhancement

### 3. Optional Fields
- Some fields may have different null handling
- **Impact:** Minimal - handled correctly
- **Status:** ✅ Recommended tests

**Verdict:** All non-blocking, doesn't affect production readiness
